# Masquerade-Season
This Novel Masquerade Season by ‘Pemi Aguda is a shockingly creative and melancholy work that establishes a perfectly plausible imagined universe from the very first sentence to the very last four stanzas.  None of us can question the novel’s hold on the imaginations of entire generations, or the strength of its condemnations that appears to expand, rather than diminish, with the passage of time. The globe is incredibly detailed and spine-chillingly scary. This story’s politics and psyche are intricately intertwined. The book’s civilization has no written rules, although many crimes are punishable by death.
